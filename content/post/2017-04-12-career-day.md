On April 7 ETAIS project managers took part in Institute of Computer Science career day to find new talents for ETAIS project.

The event was a success as three people were invited to an interview and a test job in Tartu University's HPC.  

Earlier this year three people were already hired: Ilja Livenson (cloud solutions, self-service portal and much more),
Tõnu Raitviir (cyber safety in all its forms) and Rutt Lindström (information safety in processes and documentation).  

ETAIS is a growing project. You too are welcome to contact us if you can and truly wish to contribute to the project.
